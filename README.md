# AssaultCube-v1.2.0.2-ammoModifier
Very simple Proof-of-Concept, created with the help of online tutorials and research

## AC ammoModifier

This program uses the Windows API to read, and then write the process memory of the game "Assault Cube", in its game version 1.2.0.2

## COMPILING

Compile this project under x86 Release version

## Why did I create this?

More so as a proof of concept of things I took the time to learn over the span of a Summer. Things such as pointers, Value Scanning && Memory Viewing, structures in memory,
offsets, Multilevel Pointers, the Windows API, and with this project External Memory Injection, all play a role in the end product of this proof-of-concept program.

Hope you enjoy! More to come later when I have free time. School's starting up and I definitely won't have as much time to dedicate to studying this stuff further (With calculus and all :p)
